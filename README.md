<h2> Task 1</h2>
<h3> Smart Car Parking System </h3>
The smart parking system integrating IoT technology is composed of smartphones and multiple sensors that are incorporated into an interoperable system for determining space or the level, which gives instant feedback. This can be achieved by means of cameras, counters on the doors or gates of parking lots, sensors embedded in the paved areas of individual parking lots, among other places, depending on the deployment.<br>
Software used: Arduino IDE Version 2.1.1

<h2> Task 2</h2>
<h3> Air Pollution Monitoring System </h3>
A network of sensors, connectivity technologies and data analytics platforms is used to create an Internet of Things based monitoring system for air and noise pollution. The measurement of pollutants such as particulates, gases and volatile organic compound VOCs is carried out with air quality sensors at strategic locations. The environmental noise levels and patterns are picked up by sound sensors. Through wireless or wired communication protocols, these sensors are connected to a central data management system. Once this information has been gathered, it is then processed and analysed using the cloud's Analytics Platforms in realtime. The monitoring system can be accessed through a web or mobile application that provides visual representations of the information, alerts and historical data. <br>
Software used: Arduino IDE Version 2.1.1
