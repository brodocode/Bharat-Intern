<h2> Task 1</h2>
<h3> Smart Car Parking System </h3>
The smart parking system integrating IoT technology is composed of smartphones and multiple sensors that are incorporated into an interoperable system for determining space or the level, which gives instant feedback. This can be achieved by means of cameras, counters on the doors or gates of parking lots, sensors embedded in the paved areas of individual parking lots, among other places, depending on the deployment.
Software used: Arduino IDE Version 2.1.1
